I feel lucky to have been part of two worlds - pre and post smartphone. I still remember playing in dirt. Riding bikes for no apparent reason. Being a "free range" kid, as it came to be known. The internet was a novelty, something to poke around on when the world manifest around me was thoroughly explored. Today, at the **ripe and symmetrical** age of 33, I'm reflecing on the journey that took place as I entered adulthood in an era of unprecendented technological and social change.

In high school, I didn't even have a cell phone. Plenty of other kids still used to payphones to contact their parents to snag a ride after band, football, drama, chess, and the other extra-curriculars had concluded for the day. I would call collect, blurting out ITSBYRONPICKMEUPTHANKSBYE so my mother did not have to accept the charges to speak with me.

It's hard to image that sort of hack being necessary nowadays. A lot of things have changed for the better. I got my first flip phone in my senior year. I still remember texting my first girlfriend in college on that pitiful T9 keyboard. Even at the time it seemed ancient, more trouble than it was worth.

The path from graduation and through college took me through the worlds of AIM, Myspace, Facebook, and smartphones. I used them as a crutch at times to cover for my shyness and lack of initiating in **meat space**. Other times, I let them sop up every last drop of my energy as I lay hunched over a keyboard, waiting for the next bright ping to send dopamine surging through my system. The glow of screens large and small was a constant companion to my complacent twenties.

When I moved to my first big city by my lonesome - Birmingham, Alabama, for an internship - I delved into the world of online dating. I wasn't so much meeting and staying in touch with people. I was more enjoying the validation of matching, chatting, and achieving an in-person rendez-vous. The status wins that come with that sort of thing are like heroin for someone who didn't know how to talk to girls.

Then, work life. First, a Blackberry on which to squint at emails arriving at all hours of the day. A LinkedIn profile so that recruiters could bother me about sketchy sounding contract labor. Eventually, Slack channels in which to be tagged for any little comment that would probably be rendered insignificant if the sender let it marinate for a minute more.

Every part of our worlds has truly been quantified and superconnected. You're a node in a system. It comes with a lot of nice benefits. People can more easily find causes they care about, stay in touch with family members, organize resistance against our failing governments. The rise of memes, messaging apps, video sharing tools and the like means we never have to be bored.

So why am I not connected to this virtual web of humanity? Why am I typing out blogs no one will ever read to post on a (_GASP_) personal website? In a word, it's... complicated. But if you want to learn more about Mr. Byron over here, stay tuned for next time and I'll ramble on.
